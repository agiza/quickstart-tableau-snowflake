# quickstart-tableau-snowflake
## Accelerated Analytics with Tableau and Snowflake on the AWS Cloud

This Quick Start helps you to deploy Tableau Server alongside Snowflake for fast data querying and analytics.

Tableau Server paired with Snowflake gives users a powerful platform to store, query, and analyze their data in real time. This Quick Start demonstrates the workflow for uploading data to Snowflake, publishing that data to Tableau Server, and creating analytic content on top of the live data.

You can use the AWS CloudFormation templates included with the Quick Start to deploy Tableau Server in your AWS account in about 30 minutes. The Quick Start automates the following:

- Deploying Tableau Server into a new VPC
- Deploying Tableau Server into an existing VPC

You can also use the AWS CloudFormation templates as a starting point for your own implementation.
